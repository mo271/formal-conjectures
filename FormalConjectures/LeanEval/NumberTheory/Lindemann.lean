# Lindemann's theorem and the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem

`lindemann`: both `e = exp 1` and `π` are transcendental (Lindemann 1882).
`lindemann_weierstrass`: ℚ-linearly independent algebraic numbers have
algebraically independent exponentials. Mathlib has `Transcendental`,
`AlgebraicIndependent`, and the *analytic* scaffolding of the proof
(`Mathlib.NumberTheory.Transcendental.Lindemann.AnalyticalPart`), but neither
theorem statement. (The companion irrationality of `π` is already in Mathlib
as `irrational_pi`, so it is not a candidate.)

Category-(b) candidates from §55 of the Knill survey.
