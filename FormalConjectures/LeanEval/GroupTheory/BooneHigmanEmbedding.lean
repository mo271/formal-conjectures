# Boone–Higman theorem (easy direction)

`boone_higman_embedding`: if a finitely presented group `G` embeds in a simple
group `H` that embeds in a finitely presented group `K`, then `G` has a solvable
word problem — the "if" half of the Boone–Higman characterisation. The trusted
helper `WordProblemSolvable` (a non-hole) expresses decidability of "a word
represents the identity" via `ComputablePred`. Mathlib has finitely-presented
groups, free groups, simple groups, and computability, but no notion of the word
problem or the Boone–Higman theorem. (The main Kuznetsov/Boone–Higman, Novikov,
and Higman-infinite-simple statements of §122 are already in lean-eval.)

Category-(b) candidate from §122 of the Knill survey (additional statement 1).

/-- The **word problem is solvable** for a finite presentation
`φ : FreeGroup (Fin n) →* G`: the predicate "the word `w` represents the identity
of `G`" is decidable by an algorithm. -/

/-- **Boone–Higman theorem (easy direction).** If a finitely presented group `G`
embeds (via injective `f`) into a simple group `H`, which embeds (via injective
`g`) into a finitely presented group `K`, then the word problem of `G` is
solvable. -/
