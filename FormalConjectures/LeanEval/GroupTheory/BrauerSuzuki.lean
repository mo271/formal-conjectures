# Brauer–Suzuki theorem on generalized quaternion Sylow 2-subgroups

Let `G` be a finite group whose Sylow 2-subgroups are generalized
quaternion: isomorphic to `Q_{2^n}` for some `n ≥ 3`, i.e., to Mathlib's
`QuaternionGroup (2^(n-2))` (since `QuaternionGroup m` has order `4m`,
giving `|Q_{2^n}| = 2^n` and `n = log₂|P|`). Let `t` be the unique
involution of any (equivalently, every) Sylow 2-subgroup. Then the
image of `t` in `G / O(G)` is central, where `O(G)` is the largest
normal subgroup of `G` of odd order.

R. Brauer and M. Suzuki, "On finite groups of even order whose 2-Sylow
group is a quaternion group", Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 45 (1959).
This was the precursor of Glauberman's Z*-theorem (1966) and the
historical seed of the local-analysis programme in CFSG.

The conclusion is phrased entirely in the quotient `G / O(G)`,
applied to the image of `t` under `QuotientGroup.mk`; the value of
`t : G` only enters via that map.

Introduces `Defs/OddCore.lean` since Mathlib has no `oddCore`/`O(G)`
operation.
