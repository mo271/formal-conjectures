# Jordan–Brouwer separation theorem (L. E. J. Brouwer, 1912)

§48 of Knill's *Some Fundamental Theorems in Mathematics*. The
high-dimensional generalization of the Jordan curve theorem: for
`d ≥ 2`, the complement in `ℝᵈ` of any topological `(d−1)`-sphere —
the image of any continuous injection from the unit `(d−1)`-sphere
into `ℝᵈ` — has exactly two connected components.

The hypothesis `2 ≤ d` is essential: in dimension `d = 1` the
`(d−1)`-sphere is the two-point set `{−1, 1}`, whose complement in
`ℝ` has *three* connected components (left of −1, between −1 and 1,
right of 1).

Mathlib has `Metric.sphere`, `EuclideanSpace`, `ConnectedComponents`,
`Nat.card`, but **no Jordan–Brouwer separation theorem**, no Alexander
duality, no invariance of domain in a form that would discharge it.
Stateable with no new definitions.
