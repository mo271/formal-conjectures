# Brouwer fixed-point theorem

§33 of Oliver Knill's *Some Fundamental Theorems in Mathematics* (an
additional statement in the section on game theory; Brouwer's theorem
underlies Nash's 1950 proof of equilibrium existence). Every continuous
self-map of a nonempty compact convex subset of `ℝᵈ` has a fixed point.

mathlib has the Banach fixed-point theorem (`ContractingWith.exists_fixedPoint`)
but it is strictly weaker — it requires a Lipschitz constant `< 1`.
`grep -ri brouwer` in mathlib returns only Brouwerian lattices/logics, not
the fixed-point theorem. It is theorem #36 on Freek Wiedijk's *Formalizing
100 Theorems* list and is formalized in Lean **outside mathlib** (per
mathlib's `docs/100.yaml` `links` entry), in Isabelle/AFP, HOL Light, and
Coq.
