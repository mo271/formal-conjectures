# Generalized topological Poincaré conjecture in dimensions ≥ 5 (Smale)

A specialization of mathlib's generalized `proof_wanted
ContinuousMap.HomotopyEquiv.nonempty_homeomorph_sphere` in
`Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/PoincareConjecture.lean`, restricted to
dimension `n ≥ 5`: every Hausdorff `n`-manifold homotopy-equivalent to the
standard `n`-sphere `𝕊ⁿ` is homeomorphic to `𝕊ⁿ`.

This is **Stephen Smale's 1961 theorem**, originally proved for `n ≥ 5`
assuming a smooth structure on `M` (via the `h`-cobordism theorem). The
**topological** version (no smoothness assumption) was completed by
Newman in 1966 and Connell in 1967. Smale received the Fields Medal in
1966.

mathlib has homotopy equivalences (`≃ₕ`), homeomorphisms (`≃ₜ`),
`ChartedSpace`, and the unit sphere as a topological space — but no
`h`-cobordism theorem, no handle decompositions, and no Poincaré
conjecture in any dimension.

/-- **Generalized topological Poincaré conjecture in dimensions ≥ 5**
(Smale 1961; topological case Newman 1966 / Connell 1967). For `n ≥ 5`,
every Hausdorff `n`-manifold homotopy-equivalent to the standard `n`-sphere
`𝕊ⁿ` is homeomorphic to `𝕊ⁿ`. -/
