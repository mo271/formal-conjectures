# Runge's theorem

Basic Runge approximation theorem for compact subsets of `ℂ`: if `K` is
compact and `f` is analytic on an open neighbourhood of `K`, then `f`
can be uniformly approximated on `K` by rational functions with no
poles on `K`.

This is the basic form. It does not include the standard pole-control
refinement, where poles may be chosen from prescribed points, one in
each connected component of `ℂ \ K`.

/-- **Runge's theorem.** If `K ⊆ ℂ` is compact and `f` is analytic on
an open neighbourhood of `K`, then for every `ε > 0`, `f` is uniformly
approximated on `K` by a rational function `p / q` with `q` non-vanishing
on `K`. -/
