Conjecture based on OEIS comment:
For $n \le 100$, when $n \in \{1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 23, 35, 63, 65, 69\}$, there is only one $m$
such that $A049802(m) = n$, so $a(n) = 1$.

Note: The OEIS comment lists $67$ instead of $69$, but this is a typo in the OEIS comment:
the sequence terms in OEIS have $a(67) = 5$ (e.g. $A049802(147) = A049802(2055) = 67$) and
$a(69) = 1$.
