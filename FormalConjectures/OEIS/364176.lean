The supercongruences $a(n p^r) \equiv a(n p^{r-1}) \pmod{p^{3r}}$ hold for all primes $p \ge 5$ and all positive integers $n$ and $r$.
Note: The sequence a(n) is only conjecturally integer-valued. We formalize the congruence as divisibility of real numbers, requiring that the sequence terms are indeed integers.
