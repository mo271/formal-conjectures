# OEIS A364176

a term:
$$a(n) = \frac{(15n)! (5n/2)! (2n)!}{(15n/2)! (6n)! (5n)! n!}$$
where integer factorials are evaluated using `Nat.factorial`, and fractional factorials $x!$ are defined as $\Gamma(x+1)$.

Conjecture: the supercongruences a(n*p^r) == a(n*p^(r-1)) (mod p^(3*r)) hold for all primes p >= 5 and all positive integers n and r.
Note: The sequence a(n) is only conjecturally integer-valued. We formalize the congruence as divisibility of real numbers, requiring that the sequence terms are indeed integers.
