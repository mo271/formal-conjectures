# OEIS A382590

Helper function for a, computing the pair $(a(n), b(n))$ such that:
$a(n) = a(n-1)b(n-2) + a(n-2)b(n-1)$
$b(n) = a(n-1)b(n-2) - a(n-2)b(n-1)$

a: $a(n)$ is the sequence defined by the mutual recurrence relations:
$a(n) = a(n-1)b(n-2) + a(n-2)b(n-1)$ and $b(n) = a(n-1)b(n-2) - a(n-2)b(n-1)$
starting with $a(0) = b(0) = b(1) = 1$ and a(1) = 2.
The terms are in $\mathbb{Z}$ due to negative values.

The k-th prime factor of an integer n (where k>=1), counted with multiplicity.
This is defined as the k-th element (0-indexed k-1) of `Nat.primeFactorsList n.natAbs`.
Returns 1 if n has fewer than k prime factors or if n is 0, 1, or -1, following the informal convention.

  if h₀ : k = 0 then 1 else
  let n_abs := Int.natAbs n
  let L := primeFactorsList n_abs
  -- prime factors list length is L.length. We look for k-th element, index k-1.
  if h_len : k - 1 ≥ L.length then 1 else
  L[k - 1]

a This sequence appears to have a very peculiar (conjectured) property.
For any k > 1, if you take the k-th prime factor of each term, you get an eventually periodic sequence.
This seems to hold even when we change a(1) as long as it is an integer > 1.
