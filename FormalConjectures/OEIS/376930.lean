# Prime-triggered subtraction Fibonacci-like recurrence

$a(0)=0, a(1)=1$; for $n>1$, $a(n) = a(n-1)+a(n-2)$, except when $a(n-1)$ is an odd prime, in which case $a(n) = a(n-1)-a(n-2)$.

It is not known if the sequence contains any negative terms (which may happen if two primes are adjacent or separated by one other term).

Formalization: Since the sequence is defined in $\mathbb{N}$, all terms are non-negative by definition. The conjecture's mathematical content is that whenever the subtraction rule $a(n+2) = a(n+1) - a(n)$ is applied, the result in $\mathbb{Z}$ is non-negative. In the context of $\mathbb{N}$ arithmetic, this is equivalent to asserting that $a(n+1) \ge a(n)$.
