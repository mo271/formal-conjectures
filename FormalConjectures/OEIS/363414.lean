# Imaginary part of $\prod_{k=0}^n (1 + 2k i)$

The sequence is defined by
$$a(n) = \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{Im}\left( \prod_{k=0}^n (1 + 2k i) \right)$$

Conjecture a: Type 1 primes set is empty.
It appears that every prime p divides some term of the sequence.
The claim formalizes: every prime $p$ divides some $a(n)$.

Moll's conjecture 5.5 extends to this sequence:
for the primes of type 2, the p-adic valuation $\nu_p(a(n)) \sim n/(p - 1)$ as $n \to \infty$.
This is formalized using asymptotic equivalence (`~[atTop]`) for the p-adic valuation
(`padicValInt`) converted to a real number.
