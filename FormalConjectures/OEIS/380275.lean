a: Sum of the fourth powers of the coefficients of $q$ in the $q$-factorials.
The $q$-factorial polynomial $P_n(q)$ is given by
$$P_n(q) = \prod_{j=1}^n \frac{1-q^j}{1-q} = \prod_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=0}^{j-1} q^i$$
The sequence is defined by
$$a(n) : \sum_{k \ge 0} \left([q^k] P_n(q)\right)^4$$

/-- Conjecture: In general, sum of the k-th powers of the coefficients of q in the q-factorials
is asymptotic to
$$ 2^{\frac{k-1}{2}} \cdot 3^{k-1} \cdot n!^k / (\sqrt{k} \cdot \pi^{\frac{k-1}{2}} \cdot n^{\frac{3(k-1)}{2}}) $$
We require $k > 0$ for the formula to be well-defined (due to $\sqrt{k}$).
