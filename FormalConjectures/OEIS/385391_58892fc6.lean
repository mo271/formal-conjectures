# OEIS A385391

$a(n)$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that $A384237(k) = n$.
This is formalized using the set infimum ($\mathrm{sInf}$) of the preimage of $n$.

oeis_385391_conjecture_0: a a(1) = A002110(0), a(2) = A002110(1), a(3) = A002110(2), a(6) = A002110(3), a(7) = A002110(4), a(10) = A002110(5), ...?
This conjecture is formalized as a conjunction of the listed equalities, implying a general pattern related to A065295.
