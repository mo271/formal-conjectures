# Sum involving Catalan-like triangle coefficients

The sequence is defined by
$$a(n) = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 \binom{n+k}{k} T(n, n-k)$$
where $T(n, k)$ is the array defined in A108625.

We conjecture that the present sequence satisfies the same pair of supercongruences
as the Apéry numbers A005258. Specifically, for all primes $p \ge 5$ and all
positive integers $n$ and $r$:
1) $A(n p^r) \equiv A(n p^{r-1}) \pmod{p^{3r}}$
2) $A(n p^r - 1) \equiv A(n p^{r-1} - 1) \pmod{p^{3r}}$
