# OEIS A372761

Conjecture 2: Except for 3 and 5, all odd primes appear in the sequence once.
Formally: for every natural number $p$ that is an odd prime and $p \ne 3$ and $p \ne 5$,
there is exactly one index $n \ge 3$ such that $a(n) = p$.

Recursive function to compute $A_k(n)$, the denominator tail $k - \frac{k+1}{A_{k+1}(n)}$.
The base case is at $k = n - 1$, where $A_{n-1} = (n-1) - \frac{n}{n+4}$.
