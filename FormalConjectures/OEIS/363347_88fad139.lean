# OEIS A363347

Denominator of the continued fraction
$$\frac{1}{2 - \frac{3}{3 - \frac{4}{4 - \frac{5}{\dots - \frac{n-1}{(n-1) - \frac{n}{-4}}}}}} $$
The value of the continued fraction is $C_n = 1/R_2(n)$. If $R_2(n) = N/D$ in reduced form, $C_n = D/N$.
The sequence $a(n)$ is the denominator of the final fraction, which is $\vert N \vert$.

a Conjecture 2: The sequence contains all prime numbers which end with a 1 or 9.

Helper function for a, which computes the denominator $R_k(n)$ of the continued fraction expression.
For $2 \le k \le n-1$, $R_k(n)$ is defined recursively:
$$R_k(n) = k - \frac{k+1}{R_{k+1}(n)}$$
The base case is $R_{n-1}(n) = (n-1) - \frac{n}{-4}$.
