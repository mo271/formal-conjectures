a: Decimal expansion of $207/208$.
The $n$-th term of the sequence (for $n \ge 0$) is the $(n+1)$-th digit of $207/208$
after the decimal point.
The $k$-th digit after the decimal point (for $k \ge 1$) is $\lfloor 10^k x \rfloor \pmod{10}$.
Since the OEIS sequence is 0-indexed, $a(n)$ is the $(n+1)$-th digit, $k=n+1$.

-- We must introduce a constant for the geometric quantity being conjectured.
-- Since the concept of "densest packing of truncated tetrahedra" is not in Mathlib,
-- we introduce an `opaque` constant to represent the maximum packing density $\eta_{\max}$.
-- For formalization purposes, we give it a type `Real`.

a Conjectured densest packing of truncated tetrahedra.
The maximum packing density $\eta_{\max}$ of congruent truncated tetrahedra in 3D Euclidean space
is conjectured to be $207/208$.
