# Representations as sum of three consecutive primes with parity factor

$a(n)$ is the number of ways to write $n$ as $u + (1 + (n \bmod 2)) v$ with $v \le n/2$,
where $u$ and $v$ are both sums of three consecutive primes.

Conjecture 2:
If n is an odd number greater than 905, or an even number greater than 1466, then we have a(n) > 0.
Also, a(n) > 1 for all n > 2258.
(In the case k = m = 3 for the general conjecture by Sun.)
