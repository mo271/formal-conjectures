Conjecture a: Type 1 primes set is empty.
It appears that every prime p divides some term of the sequence.
The claim formalizes: every prime $p$ divides some $a(n)$.

Moll's conjecture 5.5 extends to this sequence:
for the primes of type 2, the p-adic valuation $\nu_p(a(n)) \sim n/(p - 1)$ as $n \to \infty$.
This is formalized using asymptotic equivalence (`~[atTop]`) for the p-adic valuation
(`padicValInt`) converted to a real number.
