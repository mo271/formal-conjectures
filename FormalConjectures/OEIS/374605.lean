# Sum of products $\binom{n}{k}^2 \binom{n+k}{k} \binom{3n+2k}{n}$

The sequence is defined by
$$a(n) = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 \binom{n+k}{k} \binom{3n+2k}{n}$$

Conjecture: for prime $p \ge 5$, $a(n)$ is divisible by $p^3$ for integer $n$ in the interval $[\lceil\frac{2p + 1}{3}\rceil, p - 1]$.
The lower bound $\lceil\frac{2p + 1}{3}\rceil$ for $p \in \mathbb{N}$ is expressed using natural number division as $(2 * p + 1 + 2) / 3 = (2 * p + 3) / 3$.
