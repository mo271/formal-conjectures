# Smallest integer with given count of self-power divisor congruences

$a(n)$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that the number of divisors $d \mid k$ satisfying $d^d
\equiv d \pmod k$ equals $n$.

a(1) = A002110(0), a(2) = A002110(1), a(3) = A002110(2), a(6) = A002110(3), a(7) = A002110(4),
a(10) = A002110(5), ...?
This conjecture is formalized as a conjunction of the listed equalities, implying a general
pattern related to A065295.
