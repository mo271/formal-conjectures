A381159 51st All-Russian Mathematical Olympiad for Schoolchildren. Problem.
Let us call a natural number "lopsided" if it is greater than 1 and all its prime divisors end with the same digit.
Is there an increasing arithmetic progression with a difference not exceeding 2025,
consisting of 150 natural numbers, each of which is "lopsided"? (A. Chironov)

We formalize the positive answer to the question/conjecture.
The condition for "lopsided" for n > 1 is exactly A381159_condition n.
We require the starting term a to be at least 2 to ensure all terms are > 1.

theorem oeis_381159_conjecture_0 :
  ∃ (a d : ℕ),
    2 ≤ a ∧ -- The starting number 'a' must be lopsided, hence > 1. All subsequent terms will also be > 1.
    1 ≤ d ∧ -- 'd' must be positive for an increasing arithmetic progression
    d ≤ 2025 ∧ -- difference not exceeding 2025
    ∀ (i : Fin 150), A381159_condition (a + i.val * d)
