# Longest contiguous subsegment sum sequence

$a(0) = 1$, and for $n > 0$, $a(n)$ is the length of the longest contiguous block of preceding terms
summing to $n$, or $0$ if no such block exists.

Conjecture (OEIS a, C-line): A zero has not appeared in the sequence $a(n)$.
This is equivalent to $\forall n : \mathbb{N}, a(n) \neq 0$.
