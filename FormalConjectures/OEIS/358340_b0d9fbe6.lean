A358340 It has been proved that there exist infinitely many zeroless squares and cubes but there is apparently no proof for 4th powers, 5th powers, etc.

Formalized as the conjecture that the set of natural numbers whose fourth power is zeroless is infinite.
This is equivalent to the statement that the set $\{ m : ℕ \mid \text{is\_n\_digit}(m, n) \land \text{is\_zeroless}(m^4) \}$ is non-empty for all $n \ge 1$, ensuring $a(n)$ is defined for all $n$.
