Conjecture from OEIS A368692: $a(n)$ is an integer for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
According to A. Adolphson and S. Sperber, "On the integrality of hypergeometric series
whose coefficients are factorial ratios", ArXiv: 2001.03296, s.page 14, first equation
after Eq.(7.4): for any two integers K, L, the ratios $(3K)!(3L)!/(K!L!((K+L)!)^2)$
are proven to be integers. $108 \cdot a(n)$ results from $K = 4n+2$ and $L = 2n+3$, $n \ge 0$.
It is conjectured here that $a(n)$ are integers.
This is equivalent to the denominator dividing the numerator exactly in the definition
of $a(n)$.
