A366833: Number of times $n$ appears in A362965 (number of primes $\le$ the $n$-th prime power).
This is equivalent to: One less than the number of prime powers $q$ such that $\mathrm{prime}(n) \le q \le \mathrm{prime}(n+1)$, inclusive.
Where $\mathrm{prime}(n)$ is the $n$-th prime ($p_1=2$).
$$a(n) = \left|\left\{q \in \mathbb{N} : \text{IsPrimePow}(q) \land \mathrm{prime}(n) \le q \le \mathrm{prime}(n+1)\right\}\right| - 1$$
