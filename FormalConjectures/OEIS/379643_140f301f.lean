# OEIS A379643

List of $x$ coordinates of prime numbers in a Cartesian grid.
The sequence term $a(n)$ is given by the formula:
$$a(n) = \pi_{8,3}(p_n) - \pi_{8,7}(p_n)$$
where $\pi_{m,b}(x)$ is the number of primes $\le x$ which are congruent to $b \pmod m$
and $p_n$ is the $n$-th prime.

A379731: List of $y$ coordinates of prime numbers in a Cartesian grid.
The sequence term $b(n)$ is given by the formula:
$$b(n) = \pi_{8,5}(p_n) - \pi_{8,1}(p_n)$$
where $p_n$ is the $n$-th prime.

/-- Conjecture: no prime appears on the negative y-axis.
That is, for every $n \ge 1$, if the $x$-coordinate $a(n)$ is $0$, then the $y$-coordinate $b(n)$ must be non-negative. -/
