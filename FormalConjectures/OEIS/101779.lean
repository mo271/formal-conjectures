# Conjectures associated with A101779

$a(n)$ is the least $k$ such that all of $k, 2k+1, 3k+2, ..., nk+n-1$ are primes,
or $0$ if no such $k$ is found.
It is conjectured $k$ always exists.

The primary defining sequence `a`.
$a(n)$ is the least $k$ such that all of $k, 2k+1, 3k+2, \ldots, nk+n-1$ are primes,
or $0$ if no such $k$ is found.
