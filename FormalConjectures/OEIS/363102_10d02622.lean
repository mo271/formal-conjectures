Auxiliary sequence A051403, defined as
$$\frac{(n+2) \sum_{k=0}^n k!}{2}$$

/--
a: Denominator of the continued fraction $1/(2-3/(3-4/(4-5/(...(n-1)-n/(-2)))))$.
The sequence is defined by the formula:
$$a(n) = \frac{n^2 - 2}{\gcd(n^2 - 2, 2 \cdot A051403(n-3) + n \cdot A051403(n-4))}$$
The formula is valid for $n \ge 3$.
