# The Pompeiu problem

Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{N+1}$ be a bounded domain. A **rigid motion** is an isometry of
$\mathbb{R}^{N+1}$ (a composition of translations and rotations), modelled here by an
`AffineIsometryEquiv` of Euclidean space with itself.

The domain $\Omega$ has the **Pompeiu property** if the only continuous function
$f : \mathbb{R}^{N+1} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $\int_{\sigma(\Omega)} f = 0$ for every rigid motion
$\sigma$ is $f \equiv 0$.

The **Pompeiu problem** (Pompeiu's conjecture) asserts that, among bounded simply connected
domains with Lipschitz boundary, the Euclidean ball is the *only* domain that **fails** to have
the Pompeiu property. (That a ball fails is classical — radial functions built from Bessel
functions have vanishing integral over every congruent ball; the open direction is the converse.)

/-- `Ω` has **Lipschitz boundary** if every boundary point `p` has a neighbourhood `U` in which,
after some rigid motion `σ` (used to choose a "vertical" axis), `Ω` coincides with the strict
subgraph of a Lipschitz function `g` of the first `N` coordinates: a point `x ∈ U` lies in `Ω`
iff its last coordinate (in the `σ`-frame) is below `g` applied to its first `N` coordinates.
This is the standard definition of a Lipschitz domain. -/

**Pompeiu's conjecture.** A bounded, simply connected domain in $\mathbb{R}^{N+1}$ with Lipschitz
boundary fails to have the Pompeiu property if and only if it is a Euclidean ball. Equivalently,
the ball is the unique such domain without the Pompeiu property.

/--
The classical (easy) direction, proved by Brown–Schreiber–Taylor [BST73]: a Euclidean ball fails
to have the Pompeiu property. For a ball of radius `R`, an explicit witness is `f(x) = sin(a x₁)`
where `a > 0` is chosen so that the Bessel function `J_{n/2}(a R) = 0`; its integral over every
congruent ball vanishes.

The hard direction, the open part of the Pompeiu problem: any admissible domain lacking the
Pompeiu property must be a ball.

hypothesis in `HasPompeiuProperty` is satisfiable (the property is not vacuously false). -/
