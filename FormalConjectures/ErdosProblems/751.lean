Let $G$ be a graph with chromatic number $\chi(G)=4$. If $m_1<m_2<\cdots$ are the lengths of the
cycles in $G$ then can $\min(m_{i+1}-m_i)$ be arbitrarily large?

The answer is no: Bondy and Vince [BoVi98] proved that every graph with minimum degree at least $3$
has two cycles whose lengths differ by at most $2$, and hence the same is true for every graph with
chromatic number $4$.

This was formalized in Lean by SpringSense Innovation Institute using ChatGPT.

Let $G$ be a graph with chromatic number $\chi(G)=4$. If $m_1<m_2<\cdots$ are the lengths of the
cycles in $G$ then can $\min(m_{i+1}-m_i)$ be arbitrarily large? Can this happen if the girth of
$G$ is large?

The answer is no: Bondy and Vince [BoVi98] proved that every graph with minimum degree at least $3$
has two cycles whose lengths differ by at most $2$, and hence the same is true for every graph with
